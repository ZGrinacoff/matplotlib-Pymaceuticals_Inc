# Pymaceuticals:

Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

The task of this project was to:

* Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.

* Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.

* Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)

* Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.

## Final Analysis:

* Capomulin outperformed the Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo groups in tumor volume reduction, survival rate, and had the lowest metastatic site occurences. It was the only treatment out of the four that saw average tumor size consistently decrease over the 45 day treatment.

* Capomulin also saw significantly higher survival rates over the course of the 45 days. Being the only group with a final survival rate over 50% and a survival rate 37.5% higher than any other group throughout the course of the study.

* The average Infubinal group tumor growth was similar to that of the placebo group, but overall the average increase in metastatic sites was lower throughout the duration of treatment. The Infubinal group experienced the lowest surival rates compared with all the other drugs in the study.
